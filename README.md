# Lending-Club-Case-study
# Project Information
The project is a data science project that uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.
# Objective / Project Statement
The primary objective of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in mitigating credit losses. This challenge arises from two potential scenarios:
1. Identifying applicants likely to repay their loans is crucial, as they can generate profits for the company through interest payments. Rejecting such applicants would result in a loss of potential business. Find the driving factors which lead to the defaulted loans which are major source of loss for the company.
2. On the other hand, approving loans for applicants not likely to repay and at risk of default can lead to substantial financial losses for the company.
# Project Background
This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.
# Data Set
The data set is a csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club.
